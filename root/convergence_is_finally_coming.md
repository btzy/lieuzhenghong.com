i think the future will be

lieu, [26.11.20 14:28]
you carry a work phone and a personal phone

lieu, [26.11.20 14:28]
and there will be laptop/desktop/tablet "shells"

lieu, [26.11.20 14:29]
completely dividing up form from function

You only upgrade one device

You can keep the shells and peripherals the same

That is a key value prop imo

lieu, [26.11.20 14:29]

Just plug your phone into the dock

And then the entire wall mounted screen becomes a massive tablet

If you want to do big screen gaming plug it into your TV
