#+title: What can you buy with your complexity budget?

*TODO*

Six main things....

- Maintainability: how hard is it to maintain, extend, or modify the codebase
over a period of time?
- Performance: how quickly does the code run?
- Velocity: how fast can you write and ship your code?
- Robustness: how well does the codebase handle unexpected behaviour
(e.g. packet drops, user clicks Submit twice)?
- User-friendliness: how intuitive are your interfaces/abstractions?
