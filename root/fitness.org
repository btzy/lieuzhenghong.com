Really focused on the unilateral pulling this time
and could really feel the exercise getting much harder.

My forearms start to burn even before my back becomes sore.
Why is this? Should investigate. Maybe ask on Reddit.

3 sets of side planks / ab lifts
I find that when doing planks or ab lifts, my arms tire sooner
than my abs do. Again, need to fix this.

Don't really know what I'm doing, need to program a new workout *** Dumbbell bench press, 5kg each side (16) 16 *** Dumbbell rows 16 *** Dumbbell shoulder press
** DONE <2020-11-25 Wed>
New idea: every workout every day should hit:
- chest
- back
- arms
- shoulders
- abs
  
X = AMRAP

*** Incline dumbbell press
21 8 8 
Its not a fly its a press, so don't bring weights together at the top
https://youtu.be/uJA9dx_MMyA

Lead with the pinkies to get more extension of the elbow/more tricep
and less front delt activation
