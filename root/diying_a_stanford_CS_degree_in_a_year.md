# What would be the point?

I already have a job as a SWE,
so I've already "made it", so to speak.
So it's not really about getting a job,
and in any case if you wanted to optimise
for getting a big job offer your time would
probably be better spent grinding LC (for regular SWE jobs)
or learning the ins and outs of C++ (for quant trading).

There is obviously no credential from doing this:
but that's not that important to me
since I already have a degree from Oxford,
so there would be very little (if any) marginal signaling value.

# Can you really do it in a year?
