# My CS learning plan

## Objective

To learn what I need to be a competent individual contributor,
combining strong fundamental knowledge in computer science and machine learning 
with more practical software engineering knowledge like
Agile, TDD, React, etc. 

## Courses I plan to take, and why

### Fundamentals

- Stanford CS231n Convolutional Neural Nets

This course came recommended by both my friends and by Eric and 
reviews online suggest that it is an excellent and rigorous treatment
of computer vision.

- Labs and assignments in *Computer Networking, a Top-down approach*

This textbook comes highly recommended.
I really need to understand underlying networking concepts
like what HTTP/TCP is.
It would have come in very useful during the VAMA 2 project
because I was building a TCP socket to communicate between
the Jetson NX and a Docker container running on the Jetson.

- Stanford CS140e Operating Systems

Docker containers are always present in my work
(including in my most recent project),
but I don't really understand them.
In order to really understand how Docker containers
work, a deep knowledge of OS is required.
How and why does a Docker container differ from a VM? 
This course will help me with this
and will hopefully also help me solve problems like
the one I encountered in VAMA 2 much more quickly.

### Software engineering 

- Unit Testing and Test Driven Development in Python
- Unit Testing In-Depth
- Automated Software Testing with Python

Tests are a must for production code,
but I don't have any tests right now.
These three courses will teach me how to write 
tests for the code that I have already written.

It will also tie in with CI/CD:
I want to have a CI/CD pipeline with automated tests.

- CI/CD, DevOps for Beginners
- DevOps Essential
- GitLab CI: Pipelines, CI/CD and DevOps for Beginners

See above.

- REST API Design, Development & Management
- React: The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)

I want to work on web development after the VAMA 2
project so this is something I really want to look into.

## Timeline (TBC)
