CSI vs short courses:

We take our learnings from the short courses to make a new program the CSI.


We are introducing some new courses in CSI, we are not going to talk about compilers in-depth in CSI
Some changes to curriculum, some changes to the way we approach it.

Goal of the CSI: a graduate of the course should be able to do
senior level distributed systems, backend, infrastructure work L5
