# Approval paper 

## Aim

This paper seeks approval to provide an additional grant of $5,000 to SMEs for the
purchase of e-invoice systems during the COVID-19 period. 

## Introduction

The Circuit Breaker measures have forced SMEs to sell their products online,
which requires e-invoices/receipts. SMEs previously wrote invoices and receipts
by hand/in hard copy but this is no longer possible.  SMEs now need to purchase
e-invoice solutions to continue running their businesses, and IMDA can help them
defray this cost.

## Why SMEs need e-invoice systems now

There are two main features of e-invoice software that SMEs desperately need
now that many have moved to selling their goods on online storefronts:

1. Generating electronic purchase receipts/invoices when selling products online;
2. Integrating these electronic purchase receipts/invoices with their existing
   accounting backends.
   
Both these features are provided by good e-invoice systems. They also save
processing time and reduce human error.

## Why IMDA should support SMEs

There are two reasons why IMDA should provide a grant to SMEs in particular.

Firstly, SMEs are a particularly vulnerable group in Singapore;
they often operate on very slim margins and do a large proportion of their business 
face-to-face. The circuit breaker measures have thus impacted them heavily,
and a relatively small grant from IMDA could make a big impact.

Secondly, SMEs would benefit more from the grant. Larger multinational corporations
are likely to already have their own e-invoicing systems...

## Conclusion

SMEs are a particularly vulnerable group that have been forced to transition
to selling their products online. Many of their existing invoice systems are no
longer fit for purpose. IMDA should therefore support the purchase of new
e-invoice systems by giving a grant.

## Recommendation

This paper proposes that we provide an additional grant of \$5,000 to SMEs
specifically earmarked for the purchase of e-invoice software.

We should rollout this grant over ...
