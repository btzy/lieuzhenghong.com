that for many endeavours there are three levels of competence/knowledge

the first level is slavishly following / repeating dogma, like following a recipe when cooking, or following a recommended build in dota

the second level is being able to make smart substitutions, to riff on an existning recipe, e.g. make ingredient substitutions/know which can be elided, or when in dota adapt the build to your opponent, or when playing guitar know what chords can be substituted for others

the third level is knowing the fundamental underpinnings of your field and being able to build something ex nihilo, e.g. creating a new dish with any random arbitrary subset of ingredients, or creating interesting weird builds of your own, or going to the scientific literature to design a specific fitness routine to work for someone with one arm and one leg, etc.
