> Hand-in deliverables:
>
> Note: where the broadcom document uses addresses 0x7420xxxx, you'll use 0x2020xxxx.
> 
> You can work with someone else on this:
>   - Where are put32 and get32 defined?
>   - Write out the call to put32 that will set GPIO pin 20 to be an output
>     pin (i.e., give the address and expression used as arguments).
>   - Write out the call to put32 that will set GPIO pin 20 to be an
>     input pin (i.e., give the address and expression used as arguments).
>   - Write out the call to get32 to determine what value is held in GPIO pin 21.
