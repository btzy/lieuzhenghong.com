* TODO Become the best software engineer that I can be :WORK:OGP:CS:
** Overview
I will be a "proper" card-carrying software engineer soon.
I want to focus on being the best software engineer that I can be.
What should I learn in order to be the best?
This is what OGP's career document has to say:

:OGPCAREERDOCUMENT:
Software Engineers are competent individual contributors. 
They are comfortable with engineering tools such as source control, error
monitoring, automated testing, and more. They can successfully run systems in
production, though they may be unable to design such systems themselves. They
can reason about the practical implications of a system design and can make
useful contributions to design discussions. Overall, they are able to prioritize
engineering tasks for themselves and complete them independently.
 
Concretely this means Software Engineers are able to:

- Write code that matches the readability and design standards of the team
- Implement systems from a given architectural design
- Understand the design goals and limits of a given system and work around them
- Prioritize engineering tasks effectively and avoid getting stuck on low impact work
- Use engineering tools effectively
  - Collaborate with other engineers by writing well defined pull requests
  - Participate productively in a code review both as a reviewee and reviewer
  - Branching and merging appropriately in source control
  - Configure build tools for simplified deployment and development
  - Setup automated testing to prevent code regressions
- Operate production systems reliably
  - Setup and operate cloud infrastructure for a given architectural design
  - Implement logging and be comfortable searching through logs
  - Configure basic alert systems to minimize downtime
  - Deploy code to production using practices that minimize risk of user interruption
  - Respond to production outages and recover from simple errors
  - Conduct post mortems detailing the significant events and root cause analysis
    :END:
    
It looks like the pull request and code review part 
can be learned through OSS work (or on the job),
but how do I learn the learn automated testing and build tools?
And how do I learn everything under the section 
"Operate production systems reliably"?

What's going to give me the best bang for my buck?
Should I be working on open-source projects?
Or writing my own side projects?
Or should I learn fundamental CS concepts like networks, OS, distributed systems?
** TODO Compile the largest gaps in my CS knowledge
- Reading source code
- Force yourself to understand it by reading through the source code.
** TODO Ask mentors for advice: what should I do?

Why have costs ballooned over the past fifteen years?
Check [[https://pedestrianobservations.com/?s=singapore][Pedestrian Observations]] and wait for Alon's reply

**EDIT**
[[https://pedestrianobservations.com/][New post from Alon:]]

> It increasingly looks like the cause of high construction costs in the
English-speaking world is the trend of the privatization of the state since the
1980s. Instead of public planning departments, there is growing use of
consultants. This trend is intensifying, for example with increasing use of
design-build contracts, introduced into Canada just before costs exploded.
