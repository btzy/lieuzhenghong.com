title: "Three years in Oxford"
---

Something I hear a lot online and from many of my friends
was that university wasn't that useful for them,
they didn't learn much from their professors and/or
they could have learned just the same 
from reading textbooks/watching videos on their own.
For me personally this couldn't be further from the truth.
I learned a lot from my tutors.

Sergi would give me essay-length feedback on my essay.
My essays were ~2,000 words and
Sergi would easily write 500, 600, 800 word feedback on my essay.
And he did that with all his students.
That was an enormous time commitment

Bassel would also give me very detailed feedback
on my work
but beyond that, he was always 

I remember he invited me into his garden one time
talking about my thesis idea
Absolutely nothing to do with economics, our lessons,
or anything --- just wanted to help me out.

I had several meetings with my thesis supervisor Andy Eggers
and his comments were very helpful as well.

Not all of my tutors were so exemplary, of course,
some were just phoning it in
(the DPhil students were often guilty of this)
