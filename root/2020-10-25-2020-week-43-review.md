## Introduction

I'm reinstating the weekly review habit. See the previous blog post for
an explanation of the six different categories.

As with last week, I'll rate each category on a four-point scale:

- Excellent (exceeding expectations: better than I could've asked
  for),
- Good (meets expectations: about as good as I could've asked for),
- So-so (some good, some bad --- OK overall, but room for
  improvement),
- Bad (didn't meet my expectations --- could have done better).

Anything better than "Bad" is good.

## Review of the week

### Career

Not really preparing anything for OGP because I'm getting "stuck": I
read and re-read the description of my projects and just don't know what
else to say. For my previous projects, no technical decisions come to
mind... was agonising over the Bayesian SMS sender project and thinking
about what technical decisions I made then. I remember that I found it
difficult to design/build the entire pipeline --- e.g.Â how do I track
users? how do I get the results? but once I thought of a solution it
then became the "obvious" thing to do. So I have difficulty pointing to
a particular technical decision where I had the choice between A or B
and chose A because of reasons, as the word "decision" might imply. Now
that I write this I'm thinking that a "decision" can also be something
like choosing to implement a particular feature or not. Time management,
complexity management. I'll think about this more after my call with
Celine.

Work-wise, I was quite (very) productive on Monday and Tuesday actually.
I didn't stick strictly to the 6-pomos-in-a-row idea, but I did put in
the hours for those days. Then on Wednesday I got a bad cold was
sniffling and sneezing all over the place (seems to happen every week)
and then my productivity tanked. On Thursday I went to collect the
RealSense and that was a real bitch to get working (still haven't
figured it out). Got blocked on Thurs/Friday just trying to get it
working.

I'll try the 6-pomo-in-a-row approach again this week and try not to get
sick.

### Physical

Been quite consistent with the stretching which is good (5/7), but
that's the only thing that went well.

Created a workout routine ...

Finalised home gym purchase ...

Only exercised Monday and Friday (2/6 goal days), if I exercise today
then I bring it to 3/6 which is not great. A not-very-good excuse is
that I was incredibly sore after Monday's push workout.

I managed to get enough sleep throughout the weekday towards the end --
was waking up naturally on Thursday and Friday before the alarm. But
this was all for naught, as I still have the incredibly bad habit of
sleeping late during the weekends which is tanking my productivity
during the weekend because I just want to lie down and nap constantly.
It will also make me sleep late on Sunday night which will fuck me for
the weekday. This is a toxic cycle and will be the most important thing
to fix next week.

### Side projects

Side projects not so good this week because Joshua had some unexpected
guests and I didn't have the motivation to work alone.

### Relationships

Met Nicole for lunch on Thursday and played Among Us with the PPE gang
on Saturday. Apart from that not much but it's OK.

### Skills

Growing callouses on my fingers. It helps that Jon's guitar is right
next to me so I can pick it up anytime and just practice the chords.
Still haven't managed to pick up pumping and still not 100% confident
with going down slopes. I need to increase the level of deliberate
practice on this skill to really improve.

Not going to be too demanding on this section.

### Serendipity

This was excellent this week.

Spent about 5 hours writing code to generate cryptogram books.

Picked up DA:O and played it a fuckton. I would've liked my serendipity
to be focused on something else but I'm not grading this section on the
quality of the things I pursue serendipitously. I had originally not
played it for a long time because I didn't want to go through again what
I had remembered as a long and tedious Grey Warden section. But I was
surprised by how enjoyable it became once I started to have a good
build/ party comp.

Played it on Friday and Saturday wasted a lot of time on it.

## Overall rating this week

1.  Career: so-so
2.  Physical: bad
3.  Side projects: so-so
4.  Relationships: good
5.  Skills: good
6.  Serendipity: excellent

## What are my goals for next week?

Meta-conclusion: I need to have a _plan_ on how to fulfill my weekly
goals. It does no good to state the goals this week but have no concrete
plan on how to fulfill them, particularly if these goals are ones that I
already wrote last week.

Three big goals/wins:

1.  My first priority: prepare and ace the final round interview
2.  Create a healthy sleep schedule, particularly on weekends!!
3.  Try to carry on with the 6 pomos/day work schedule.

Other priorities:

1.  Keep up the momentum of my two side projects
