## Introduction

I'm reinstating the weekly review habit. See the previous blog posts for
an explanation of the six different categories.

The six categories are:

1. Career
2. Physical
3. Side projects
4. Skills
5. Relationships
6. Serendipity

As with last week, I'll rate each of the six categories on a four-point scale:

- Excellent (exceeding expectations: better than I could've asked
  for),
- Good (meets expectations: about as good as I could've asked for),
- So-so (some good, some bad --- OK overall, but room for
  improvement),
- Bad (didn't meet my expectations --- could have done better).

## Review of the week


### What should I be focusing on now?

So being good in my career is going to be my main goal
when I successfully transfer.
What about now in this limbo period?
What do I do? I could take it as a break:
just do whatever's fun.

## What my goals are for next week

- Think and ask around for advice a lot
  about what I need to learn in order to become a better SWE
- Actually start doing proper work at IMDA
- Carry on meeting and video calling my friends
