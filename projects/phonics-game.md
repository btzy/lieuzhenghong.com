## Phonics Game

July 2018

![screenshot of phonics game](/img/phonics_game/phonics_game.png)

An educational game for kids aged 7-8 to learn "vowel teams", made for the
Ministry of Education. I didn't know what a vowel team was
until I started this project.

Built with HTML Canvas and JavaScript, with art from the (extremely) talented
Shan Wei. Available to play [here](lieuzhenghong.com/phonics-game-poc).
