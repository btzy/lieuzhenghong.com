## Automated Transaction Tracker

August 2016

![screencap of automated transaction tracker](/img/automated_transaction_tracker/automated_transaction_tracker.gif)

I built the Army's first item tracker and automatic SMS reminder system
(that I know of),
for use in the Army's logistics branch.

It's written in React and Node.js, and uses MongoDB on the back end.

The system decreases administrative overhead
by automatically keeping count of all items in the store (item tracker),
and sending SMSes to remind borrowers who have borrowed items from the store
but have not returned them in time.
The system will also automatically notify the supervisor of the store
so that appropriate disciplinary action can be taken.

This system won second prize in the Army's Annual Innovation Contest.
