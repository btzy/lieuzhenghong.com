# Introduction

This is going to be a reference page so I know
what to do and
why I'm doing it.

# Goals

My priorities are to shore up my weaknesses and
then build upon my strengths.
In decreasing order of priority, therefore, my goals are:

- Fix my anterior pelvic tilt
- Fix my internal shoulder rotation
- Increase flexibility
- Increase strength and hypertrophy

To that end, I'll be doing the following:

1. Stretch every day with Starting Stretching (SS) routine
2. (For internal shoulder rotation) Add doorway face pulls,
   subscapularis and pec minor stretches to the SS routine
3. (For APT) Add modified sprinter lunge to the SS routine
4. Perform 6-day push-pull bodyweight routine

## Anterior pelvic tilt

I have mild anterior pelvic tilt (APT).
The natural angle of anterior pelvic tilt should be 3-4 degrees downward
on the waistline, mine is a bit more than that, I think.

To remedy this, I'll be following Athlean-X's tips for anterior pelvic tilt
(video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-CrEi0ymMg)].

1. Donâ€™t stretch hamstrings
2. Strengthen glutes with the "modified sprinter lunge" shown in the video
   (around 4:31)
3. Stretch lower back
4. Stretch hip flexors (part of Starting Stretching, more later)
5. Strengthen abs without engaging hip flexors

### Strengthening the glutes and stretching the hip flexors

### Strengthening the abs

I will be doing two main exercises that don't strengthen the hip flexors
because training the hip flexors can exacerbate APT.
[Athlean-X link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIhCuqtC0r0):

> Many different ab exercises enlist the help of the hip flexors as a prime
> mover. This occurs a lot in lower ab exercises but can also occur in things
> as simple as the crunch. If you allow your ab training to include too many of
> these you will wind up simply over strengthening the hip flexors more and
> leads to a vicious cycle of more pain.

I've chosen two main exercises from the video to do:

1. Side plank (with optional leg lift)
2. Gymnast "captain's chair" back protraction

I will be doing these ab exercises in my daily hypertrophy routine
(more on this later).

## Internal shoulder rotation

I have very bad internal shoulder rotation due to a combination of
i) benching too much without doing as much horizontal pull work and
ii) spending too much time in internal shoulder rotation (typing on keyboard)

Again following
[Athlean-X's recommendations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLwTC-lAJws)

Editing a YouTube comment here:

1. 2:50, Thoracic spine stretch: Stomach on ground, arms above head 45\* angle,
   rotate back while keeping chest wide open, working your way to the left and
   right side
2. 5:48, _Subscapularis stretch_: 30 seconds:
   externally rotate arm as much as you can,
   hook arm against doorway.
   While arm is kept back way rotate your chest out in the other direction
3. 07:08, _Pec minor stretch_:
   hold shoulder back against door,
   pinch shoulder blades together,
   raise arm up
4. 08:26, _Band pull-aparts_:
   Externally rotate arms away with thumbs pulled back,
   keeping shoulders/traps down, 20 sets of 1
5. 10:27, _Band serratus/lower trap exercise_:
   Whilst holding a resistance band,
   protract your arms (without rounding the back).
   Externally rotate arms out just enough to feel band tension.
   Raise above the head, down, reset, repeat

I'm going to do the first three stretches every day as riders to the SS routine.

I will also be doing
[doorway face pulls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-XpxwHqc8g&feature=youtu.be&t=260).
Face pulls strengthen the posterior deltoids which should help pull back the shoulders.

## Flexibility

I am very inflexible.
I can't touch my toes, my hamstrings are very tight, my shoulders are tight,
everything that can be tight is tight.
I would like to do the splits eventually.
Here's what that looks like now:

I'm doing Starting Stretching every day, but skipping the hamstring stretch.
Here's an infographic:

## Strength and hypertrophy

I'll be starting with a Push-Pull bodyweight bodybuilding routine
that I found on /r/naturalbodybuilding.

The PDF is in this directory and
the Reddit post is
[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/naturalbodybuilding/comments/fivvhv/the_quarantine_workout_template/.compact).

### Pull

1. Heavy vertical pull 2-5
2. Medium intensity horizontal pull 2-5
3. Bicep isolation 2-5
4. Side delt isolation 2-8
5. Heavy hamstring exercise 2-5
6. Medium intensity hamstring exercise 1-5
7. Abs 3

### Push

1. Heavy horizontal press 2-5
2. Medium intensity incline press 2-5
3. Triceps isolation 2-5
4. Heavy quad compound 2-5
5. Medium intensity quad compound 2-5
6. Straight legged calf exercise 3-8

For ab work I'll be doing the exercises I wrote in the previous section:
these are

1. Side plank (with optional leg lift), and
2. Gymnast "captain's chair" back protraction.

I'll be replacing some of the exercises with dumbbell work:
for instance, I'll be using DBs for lat raises,
and could consider DB squats if pistol squats get too easy.

I might also consider working in vertical presses
sometimes to replace the incline press e.g. DB shoulder press.

### Warm-up

Pasting directly from the
[Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/naturalbodybuilding/comments/fivvhv/the_quarantine_workout_template/fxs16z5/)
for reference:

Do this before every session:

#### Part 1: Elevating your core temperature.

Here you can either do 3-5 minutes of LIGHT cardio (brisk walk/bike
ride/elliptical), or super light full body exercises like the ones you can
see in this video. Since the only objective here is elevating your body
temperature, you absolutely don't want to get tired, out of breath or sore,
just stop when you feel like you're warm enough. Breaking a sweat is ok.

#### Part 2: Dynamic warm-up.

Here you want to move explosively through the ranges of motion you're going
to be using in the workout. Follow this protocol:

- 10 leg swings front to back (explosive).
- 10 leg swings side to side (explosive).
- 10 big arm circles forward (explosive).
- 10 big arm circles backwards (explosive).
- 10 cross body arm slaps (explosive).
- 5 repetitions (per leg) of a lunge with torso rotation
  (only if for you it's a light exercise and doesn't tire you).

After that, the regular training session starts. Then, do the following
before every exercise that's going to work a muscle group for the first time
in the session (for example if in the same session you have two exercises for
the chest, then do the following only before the first one):

#### Part 3: Sport-Specific Warm Up.

Do a set of 5 reps from the previous level of the exercise you're about to
do. So if you're warming up to do the horizontal press level 3, in this
instance do one set of 5 reps of the horizontal press level 2. If you're
warming up for a level 1 exercise, and its intensity can be lowered as
explained here, do the lower intensity version; and if the intensity can't be
lowered, do 5 partial reps: 2 partials from the bottom part of the movement,
and 3 partials from the top part of the movement. If you're about to do an
exercise without a specific level, use a lighter exercise that targets the
same muscle group.

Rest for a few seconds and then do your working exercise for half of the
reps. So if you're warming up to do incline push-ups, and last time you got
12 reps in your first set, then in this instance do one set of incline
push-ups for 6 reps. Rest for a minute, and start your regular working sets.

## Conclusion
