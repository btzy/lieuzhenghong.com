are thinking about building our own home gym.

# Update 4th October 2020

Discussed with Bryan: either put it inside my room or outside in the space between
both of our houses.

Prices are actually pretty reasonable: should be <\$2000 for the entire set.

# Update 7th

# Update 9th October 2020

I did some research and standing racks are right out because they take up far
too much space.

Bryan seems to be having cold feet about the whole thing.
He balked at the price.
