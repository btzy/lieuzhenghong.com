**This is a draft**.

## Introduction

Ben Kuhn's blog has a [blogroll](https://www.benkuhn.net/blogroll/)
and I thought it was an idea good enough to steal.
(I guess it's a more grown-up version of the blogrolls we used to have
back when every single one of us had a blogspot.com).

And I'm also apeing his call to action:
if there's a blog you like, or think I'd like,
_please_ send an email to me: I really love reading!

## People whose writing I admire

- [Ben Kuhn](https://www.benkuhn.net/): I first found his blog on HN with the post
  [how to make your video calls almost as good as face-to-face](https://www.benkuhn.net/vc/).
  My favourites:

  - [why and how to start a startup serving emerging markets](https://www.benkuhn.net/emco/),
  - [Stop your video calls from stuttering](https://www.benkuhn.net/vcnet/),
  - [Be impatient](https://www.benkuhn.net/impatient/).

- [Robert Heaton](https://robertheaton.com/): devilishly clever, very offbeat,
  dreadfully funny. I first found his blog on HN, on the post
  [preventing impossible game levels with cryptography](https://robertheaton.com/preventing-impossible-game-levels-using-cryptography/). I really liked this post
  because it goes deep (you learn a lot) while staying interesting and funny
  throughout. Robert has this unique conceit of using a "frame story" to talk about
  dry technical concepts, which I really enjoy.
  My favourites:

  - [I got married and had kids so you don't have to](https://robertheaton.com/married-with-kids/),
  - [Lessons from a Silicon Valley job search](https://robertheaton.com/2014/03/07/lessons-from-a-silicon-valley-job-search/),
  - [Tales from a San Francisco housing search](https://robertheaton.com/2014/10/25/tales-from-a-san-francisco-housing-search/)
  - [Parenthood #3: Oscar Heaton, Quarterly Baby Review](https://robertheaton.com/2019/08/25/parenthood-3-oscar-heaton-quarterly-baby-review/)
  - [A blogging style guide](https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/06/a-blogging-style-guide/),
  - [I Might Be Spartacus: a differential privacy marketplace](https://robertheaton.com/2018/10/28/i-might-be-spartacus-differential-privacy-marketplace/)

- [Wicked Fighting](https://www.wickedfighting.wordpress.com):
  His faculty with words is unparalleled, and even when I don't agree with him
  I still find his writing witty and cutting and a joy to read.
  He has the genius talent of coming up with absolutely savage zingers.
  My favourite posts:
  one where
  he [shits on PSC scholars](https://wickedfighting.wordpress.com/2019/04/01/the-problem-with-psc-scholars/)
  (I loved this one for the zinger "policy-based evidence making"),
  another one where
  he [shits on Five Guys](https://wickedfighting.wordpress.com/2019/12/29/review-five-guys/),
  yet another where
  he [shits on Singapore's mandatory conscription](https://wickedfighting.tumblr.com/post/50830029264/every-singaporean-son).
  I also loved this
  [beautiful and inspiring post on legal activism](https://wickedfighting.wordpress.com/2019/02/01/vignettes-of-work-8/),
  and I'll quote the last paragraph here:

> One more thing about the public record â€“ cases will be read. All lawyers
> trace the ancestry of their knowledge to those who came before. And
> constitutional lawyers especially, will learn from the mistakes of the old,
> and craft a better case. A new song to move even the shrivelled hearts of old
> men and women.

## Well-known people on the internet

- [Slate Star Codex](https://www.slatestarcodex.com): this one needs no introduction,
  I think.

- [Gwern](https://gwern.net): ditto.

- [Shamus Young](https://www.shamusyoung.com): writes wonderfully about video
  games and explains video game development/programming very well. Was one of the
  first writers I ever read.

- [Patrick McKenzie](https://www.kalzumeus.com/), or patio11.
  Very famous for his success in building and running successful SaaSes: see
  [Running a Software Business on 5 hours a Week](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/03/20/running-a-software-business-on-5-hours-a-week/).
  But my favourite posts are actually his posts about living and working in Japan:
  [Doing Business in Japan](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2014/11/07/doing-business-in-japan/),
  (I particularly liked his anecdote about the local bank he used).
  I also really liked [Identity Theft, Credit Reports, and You](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2017/09/09/identity-theft-credit-reports/)
  where---after reading the article---I almost wanted to have my credit hstory
  stolen so I could avail myself of the advice in the article and tear the CRAs
  a new one.
  He's also great at explaining interesting things:

  - [How Discount Brokerages Make Money](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2019/6/26/how-brokerages-make-money/),
  - [Japan's Hometown Tax](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2018/10/19/japanese-hometown-tax/).

- [Bret Deveraux](https://acoup.blog/): writes a very famous history blog.
  I really liked his Logistics series and the farming series.

## People I know IRL

- [Joy Wang](https://joyw.home.blog/):
  We're neighbours(ish) and we were batchmates in Oxford.
  Her piece
  [Complex systems without a leader](https://joyw.home.blog/2020/06/25/complex-systems-without-a-leader/)
  was absolutely brilliant
  (what do Overwatch teams, neurons, and blockchain have in common?)
  And I've always wondered
  [why Singaporean shows have terrible writing](https://joyw.home.blog/2020/01/06/why-singaporean-shows-have-terrible-writing/)

- [Chin Kee Yong](https://chinkeeyong.wordpress.com/):
  We've known each other for over a decade now.
  Back in secondary school we collaborated on several different projects
  (read: I just bounced ideas off him and he did all the work).
  I've always admired him for his
  clear, punchy, and funny writing---it hits all the right notes without wasting your time.
  and truly creative mind.
  I really liked this
  [original screenplay he wrote](https://chinkeeyong.wordpress.com/2018/11/30/the-inquisitor-of-infernus-2018/).
  CKY is also a world-class worldbuilder.
  He designed an entire
  [alchemical fantasy setting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FHj3YAeYrdEqU139bZgmVLNQH3DJVXCeiY8AQO193CE/edit))
  when we were like, what, 16?
  and has written
  [several](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n8lWNNVTRDXmjNJLypVELQNFSF6rOp9oBQjxncAj27Y/edit)
  companion works.
  He's currently working on an incredibly ambitious interactive fiction (IF) game
  based on that setting.
  that's already been [praised by Emily Short](https://emshort.blog/2017/12/28/2017-in-interactive-fiction/)
  (queen of IF), but has also built loads of other games like
  [a chess tower defence game](https://chinkeeyong.itch.io/chess-defense).
