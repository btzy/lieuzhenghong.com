I read Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) at Merton College, Oxford.
In my degree I most enjoyed learning about
game theory, computational political science, and causal inference.

I also like computer science and data science.
My favourite MOOCs are
Noam Nisan and Simon Shocken's NAND 2 Tetris,
Tim Roughgarden's Algorithms, and
Martin Odersky's Functional Programming Specialisation.
You can read my reviews of them and several other courses [here](/moocs).

I like building things: some useful, others useless, but always fun.
You can read about some of them [on my projects page](/projects).
