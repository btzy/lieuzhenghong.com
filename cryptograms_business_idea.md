## Steps

- Farm quotes or excerpts from books or whatever (pull from where? any theme?)
  - look at how TypeRacer gets its quotes
  - or do something like "best quotes in literature", whatever,
    famous literary quotes...
  - maybe even poems? sonnets? <-- too cheem?
  - best Bible verses [here](https://www.scribd.com/document/39145334/Compilation-of-Inspirational-Bible-Verses)
- Create the puzzles from those quotes
  - consider first localising to UK or Am spelling (could be a selling point)
- Set the puzzles into a standard size with large type and ample margins

  - draw empty boxes above the jumbled characters? (some do, some don't)
  - we could use either ▯ or □ or just underscores
  - old people can't read sans serif fonts, make sure characters are different
    enough from one another
  - we might have to have a maximum character length so as not to have to
    extend/overflow pages
  - looks like the "standard" size is 8.5' x 11' with 28pt type

- Generate a hints and answers page
- Create a nice cover
  - ape the covers from
    [Game Nest](https://www.amazon.com/Game-Nest/e/B081D3D9XB?ref_=dbs_p_pbk_r00_abau_000000)

What is the best puzzle you've ever solved? What's the most memorable thing about it?

I finally did it! I created a puzzle book that everyone loves to solve. A cryptogram or cryptoquote is a puzzle where the letters of a quotation are rearranged, and you try to crack the code. Solving cryptograms always gives me a better feeling than when I solve repetitive sudoku or word searches, and they are even more exciting than crosswords. If you want a challenging mental workout, enjoy insightful ideas, or want to discover unexpected solutions, then you also need to experience the thrill of cryptograms.

In this book, you will find:

    Five hundred carefully selected cryptogram puzzles, two sets of hints, full solutions, and some tips on how to solve them. I searched through thousands of quotations to create the best puzzles for you.

    This book is meticulously formatted and proofread - no spinning your wheels on typos, grammar mistakes, hint errors, or code repetitions.

    LARGE PRINT FORMATTING! Your eyes will thank you, and there is plenty of space for finding solutions.

    A variety of simple, medium, and hard difficulty puzzles, but no dull or impossible solutions.

    These puzzles are suitable for kids or adults. I don't use quotations with swear words or nasty phrases.

    Keep your brain young and fit. Puzzle-solving can slow or reduce cognitive decline.

Imagine puzzle solutions that reveal insightful and wise sayings, so that you can have a smile on your face each day.

I realize that most people don't get just one puzzle book, but please be careful. There are many books using thousands of quotations, but I doubt they are all interesting. Other books may have frustrating typos, lousy formatting, or force you to solve obscenities. I wouldn't want any of that to happen to you.

Now, I am blessed to provide you with the fourth volume from my best-selling Amazon series with top reviews. To enjoy many hours of entertainment, please get your copy of Cryptograms #4: 500 LARGE PRINT Cryptoquote Puzzles of Insight and Wisdom today!
