          <h1> Building an Bayesian SMS sender </h1>
          <p>I architected and built a system that programmatically sends SMSes and tracks
each one to see if it has been clicked. I used the pipeline to conduct a
behavioural economics experiment on ~2000 users to investigate the effect of
loss-aversive framing on clickthrough rates. I used Bayesian statistics
(Thompson sampling) to maximise the number of people who were reached by the
optimal SMS.</p>
<p>I also sent various other SMSes (a total of ~10,000 messages). Overall,
my interventions increased the number of active users by ~25% over a period of
two months.</p>
<p>(Summer 2019 internship with Inzura)</p>
<hr>
<p>As far as I am aware, this is the first behavioural economics experiment that
uses Thompson sampling. There are very good reasons why most experiments don't
(I elaborate upon this later), but I argue that the multi-armed bandit approach
I used had several advantages over traditional A/B testing.</p>
<p>I had previously written a <a href="/2019/07/12/bayesian-inference-thompson-sampling-and-the-mab.html">more technical
post</a> on
Bayesian inference and Thompson sampling. Those interested in the details (or
interested in picking apart my misunderstandings) are most welcome to peruse
it. This post will talk about <em>why</em> I built the pipeline and the architecture
of the pipeline, not the maths.</p>
<p>I have deliberately been vague about the details of the policy and campaign, to
safeguard the privacy of our client.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>Our client is a large insurer who had rolled out a new policy that used our
app. If the policyholder uses the app to record his driving (and fulfills some
other conditions), he will be eligible for a cashback. However, people were not
installing the app. Our working hypothesis was that people had either forgotten
about the app, or had forgotten that they had to install it/use it to be
eligible for a cashback. Therefore, we wanted to send reminder SMSes to these
customers and see if we could get more uptake of the app.</p>
<p>As we were going into this blind, we wondered what sort of SMSes would be most
effective. We decided to send three SMSes---a neutral reminder SMS, a
&quot;positive&quot; SMS, and a &quot;negative&quot; SMS</p>
<p>Our purpose was twofold: i) to get as many people to install the app, and
ii) to see which type of SMS was the most effective.</p>
<h3>Why three types of SMSes?</h3>
<p>Behavioural economics predicts that people are loss-averse: that is, they feel
the pain of a loss more acutely than they feel the pleasure of an equivalent
gain. My hypothesis was that an SMS worded to trigger loss aversion (&quot;Install
the app now or lose the cashback you're eligible for&quot;) would be more effective
than an SMS worded positively (&quot;Install the app now to gain a cashback&quot;), which
would in turn be more effective than a neutral reminder SMS (&quot;Install the app
now&quot;).</p>
<h3>Why frame the experiment as a multi-armed bandit?</h3>
<p>The gold standard of causal inference is to do a randomised controlled trial:
randomly divide, say, 2400 participants into groups of 800 each, then send 800
the neutral (control), 800 the positive, and 800 the negative. Record the
number of successes (clicked SMS) and failures (did not click SMS) for each
treatment.</p>
<p>This is Good and Rigorous™. In particular, it maximises our certainty about the
performance of each treatment. In most experimental contexts, this is fine.
Most experiments try to uncover some fact about the world, and to maximise our
certainty in the truth of those facts. But there are three additional
considerations with this experiment design when it comes to the real world.</p>
<p>The first and biggest consideration is that nobody is going to let you run it
because this is leaving money on the table. With this design 2/3rds (1600) of
the customers will be getting a suboptimal SMS. In a business environment, we
want to <strong>maximise the number of customers who receive the optimal SMS</strong>, not
really maximise the certainty of our knowledge.</p>
<p>The second consideration is that we don't really want to be certain about the
performance of every treatment. We want to be certain of the <em>best</em> treatment,
which means that a uniform allocation (800 SMSes to each group) is nonideal.
[^1]</p>
<p>The third consideration is that we don't have to send all the SMSes at the same time.
We can send a subset of the SMSes and use that initial data to draw tentative
conclusions about which SMS is the best.</p>
<p>[^1]: This is the problem of &quot;best arm identification&quot;. For N &gt; 2, it isn't optimal to pull all arms equally. If one arm is very obviously worse than the rest, the algorithm shouldn't waste time on pulling it more. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/COLT10_ABM.pdf">this paper</a> (Best Arm Identification in Multi-Armed Bandits) has more details. See also <a href="https://icml.cc/Conferences/2009/papers/229.pdf">this paper</a> on Heoffding and Bernstein races where the objective is to try to establish the best action at a given confidence level with the fewest pulls.</p>
<p>Given that we want to maximise the number of customers who receive the optimal
SMS, the traditional experimental design is nonoptimal. But we don't know which
SMS is best, so how do we find out as quickly as possible, and then maximise
the number of customers who receive it?</p>
<p>It turns out that this problem can be neatly modeled as a &quot;multi-armed bandit&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You are walking around the casino floor where there are ten slot machines,
each with a different probability of paying out. How should one pull the slot
machines in order to maximise one’s payout over the long run?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this case, we have three slot machines (neutral, positive and negative
SMSes). And since we don't know <em>which</em> arm is best, we have to send some SMSes
initially to find out.</p>
<p>But there's a balance to be struck here. We want to spend some time learning,
but after we're &quot;pretty sure&quot; about what the best arm is, we should keep
pulling the best arm all the time. This is known as the explore vs exploit
tradeoff (or, more pithily, &quot;learn or earn&quot;). We can see now why the initial
experiment design was not fit for purpose: it's very good at learning, but no
good at earning. (And we're trying to earn money here!)</p>
<h3>Why Thompson sampling?</h3>
<p>There are many proposed algorithms to solve the multi-armed bandit problem:
these include epsilon-greedy, upper confidence bounds (UCB) and Thompson sampling.</p>
<p>I spent about a week
<a href="https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/01/23/the-multi-armed-bandit-problem-and-its-solutions.html#bandit-strategies">reading</a>
<a href="http://iosband.github.io/2015/07/19/Efficient-experimentation-and-multi-armed-bandits.html">the</a>
<a href="http://iosband.github.io/2015/07/28/Beat-the-bandit.html">literature</a> and
thinking about it and eventually decided on Thompson sampling. More details are
covered in my <a href="/2019/07/12/bayesian-inference-thompson-sampling-and-the-mab.html">more technical
post</a>.</p>
<h2>Experiment design</h2>
<p>I decided on the following three SMSes (neutral, positive and negative):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You have not logged any trips. The &lt;POLICY&gt; you have purchased
requires you to log trips regularly on the &lt;APP&gt; app.
Install the app and start logging your trips today. Any problems, call &lt;NUM&gt;, or
email &lt;EMAIL&gt;. Click here to start: http://&lt;*&gt;.inz.ai/&lt;SMS_ID&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You have not logged any trips. The &lt;POLICY&gt; you have purchased requires you to
log trips regularly on the &lt;APP&gt; app. Install the app and start logging your
trips today to be eligible for your (up to) &lt;AMT&gt; cashback! Any problems, call
&lt;NUM&gt;, or email &lt;EMAIL&gt;. Click here to start: http://&lt;*&gt;.inz.ai/&lt;SMS_ID&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>

&lt;NUM&gt;, or email &lt;EMAIL&gt;. Click here to start: http://&lt;*&gt;.inz.ai/&lt;SMS_ID&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While traditional multi-armed bandits allow you to pull one arm at a time and
wait for the results, we didn't have the luxury of time here. Here we have to
send thousands of SMSes in a short period of time, and we can't wait for the
result of an SMS to come in (a user might take days to click an SMS if at all)
before sending the next one. The simplest way is to simply send more SMSes in
one go, but I wasn't sure if this would affect any of the nice guarantees (e.g.
regret bounds) of Thompson sampling. I tried <a href="https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/416951/multi-armed-bandit-where-you-must-pull-n-pulls-in-t-timesteps">asking
StackExchange</a> but got no response.</p>
<p>I had to push through in any case. The modified Thompson sampling procedure
works as follows. I start by sending a total of 300 SMSes per batch: in
expectation, 100/100/100 of each type. Some of these SMSes will be clicked on
and some will not.</p>
<p>Once the results come in, the algorithm will preferentially choose to send more
of the better-performing SMS and fewer of the worst-performing one. For
instance, after the first round the algorithm might send 124/80/96.</p>
<p>As more batches are sent, the algorithm builds up a better and better picture
of the relative efficacy of each SMS, and will converge upon sending the best
SMS exclusively.</p>
<p>In this experiment I sent 6 batches of SMSes.</p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>I knew what SMSes I wanted to send; I now had to build a system that would
allow me to send it.</p>
<p>There are four key parts of this pipeline:</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>Inzura server that contained customer data</li>
<li>NGINX server to log clicked SMSes</li>
<li>PostgreSQL database to log customer data and status of all SMSes sent</li>
<li>Multi-armed-bandit code to calculate the optimal number of each SMS to send</li>
</ol>
<p>I logged clicked SMSes in the following way:</p>
<h3>SMS tracking architecture</h3>
<p><img src="/img/sms_pipeloop/sms_pipeloop_0.png" alt=""></p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: The most important part is to measure the effectiveness of each SMS variant
(neutral, positive or negative). I generate unique SMS IDs (3 alphanumeric characters + checksum)
for each SMS and append them to a template string, making a unique SMS
string. I then make GET requests to the service that sends SMSes, the Ant API.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2 and 3</strong>: The user receives an unique SMS with a link at the end. Upon
clicking it, the user is taken to a <em>logging server</em> on the <code>inz.ai</code> domain,
which logs the ID of the SMS and redirects the user to the app store.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: I download the server's logs and process it, and update my database
of which SMSes have been clicked.</p>
<h3>Data analysis and MAB architecture</h3>
<p><img src="/img/sms_pipeloop/sms_pipeloop_1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now that I had a system to log SMS clicks, I had to implement the experiment.</p>
<p>First I had to create a PostgreSQL database and decide upon the schema for it.</p>
<p>Secondly, I had to pull customer data from the Inzura server and add it to
the PostgreSQL database to identify eligible customers (we
obviously don't want to send reminder SMSes to customers who have already
installed the app).</p>
<p>Third, I had to write the Thompson sampling code that would read the data
from the database (the slot machine labeled &quot;MAB&quot;). It calculates the optimal
number of each SMS to send given the SMSes' past performances.</p>
<p>Finally, we generate unique SMSes and give them to the Ant API, and the cycle
restarts. I call this a &quot;pipeloop&quot; because it's a pipeline that loops upon itself.</p>
<h3>Thompson sampling code</h3>
<p>This is the code that performs Thompson sampling. First, some definition:</p>
<p>Each arm is a tuple of the number of clicks and no-clicks of each SMS plus one.
For instance, if I had sent 100 SMSes and there were 7 clicks, then the arm
would be (8, 94).</p>
<p>The code takes a tuple of arms e.g. <code>[(8, 94), (15, 87), (2, 103)]</code> and the
number of samples we want to take (ergo the number of SMSes we want to send
this batch). It will then give us the optimal number of each SMS to send. In
the example above, the algorithm will tell us to send more of the 2nd SMS, some
of the 1st SMS, and almost none of the 3rd.</p>

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>I got a null result. There wasn't much of a difference between loss-aversive
SMSes (negative framing), positive SMSes and neutral SMSes.</p>
<p>Because we are using Bayesian statistics here, we can calculate the probability
that loss-aversive SMSes are more effective than neutral or positive ones
directly.</p>
<p>I calculated the following using a simulation approach:</p>
<p>There is a <strong>26.6%</strong> probability that <span style="color:blue">loss-aversive
SMSes</span> are more effective than <span style="color:red">neutral</span> SMSes.</p>
<p>There is a <strong>60.7%</strong> probability that <span style="color:blue">loss-aversive
SMSes</span> are more effective than <span style="color:green">positive</span> SMSes.</p>
<p>Obviously none of these results are very credible.</p>

<p>The following diagrams are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution">beta
distributions</a>. Think of them
as a measure of our uncertainty in the effectiveness of each SMS. The x-axis
measures the effectiveness of each SMS, and the y-axis measures our degree of
certainty. The higher and sharper the distribution, the more certain we are
about the effectiveness of an SMS.</p>
<p>The diagrams show the evolution of the estimates over time by SMS
variant: <span style="color:red">red</span> is neutral, <span
style="color:green">green</span> is positive, and <span
style="color:blue">blue</span> is negative. Overall we can see that the
distributions lie very closely to one another.</p>
<p>When we begin, we have no idea how effective the SMSes are, so we assume that
all SMSes form a uniform distribution. [^2]
<img src="/img/sms_pipeloop/prior_0.png" alt="">
<img src="/img/sms_pipeloop/prior_1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As we send SMSes and get the results back we begin to update our beliefs about
the SMSes. Here the <span style="color:red">neutral</span> SMSes seem to do
best and thus the Thompson sampling algorithm chooses to send a lot of it.</p>
<p><img src="/img/sms_pipeloop/prior_2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>But the good performance of the neutral SMSes is quickly revealed to be a fluke
as more SMSes are sent out.</p>
<p><img src="/img/sms_pipeloop/prior_3.png" alt="">
<img src="/img/sms_pipeloop/prior_4.png" alt="">
<img src="/img/sms_pipeloop/prior_5.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Eventually after all the SMSes have been sent we realise that all of the SMSes
are about the same in effectiveness.</p>
<p>Due to time constraints, I could not run further experiments: I did A/B testing
henceforth sending multiple reminder messages and again got null results. So
I'm glad this was a very robust null finding :P</p>
<p>Nonetheless, my further interventions were able to increase the number of
active users by around ~25%. I will not reveal numbers here for privacy
reasons, but this had a real business impact because Inzura gets paid per
monthly active user.</p>
<p>[^2]: The choice of a uniform prior was because I had never run an experiment like this before, and had no idea what the clickthrough rate of an SMS was supposed to be. For subsequent experiments I would initialise the priors at around a 0.07 click rate.</p>
<h2>What I learned</h2>
<p>I gained valuable practice in designing an experiment and carrying it to
completion. I had originally wanted to kill two birds with one stone and use
this for my BEE thesis, but a null finding isn't particularly exciting, so I
will keep looking. [^3]</p>
<p>[^3]: Yes, I know I'm contributing to publication bias---but my grades are on the line here...</p>
<p>I learned quite a lot about Bayesian inference in the course of designing the
experiment, and would like to learn more about it. When I have more bandwidth I
will consider doing the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/probabilistic-graphical-models">Probabilistic Graphical Models MOOC by Daphne
Koller</a>,
and reading Judea Pearl's co-authored book on DAGs (highly recommended by Bassel).</p>
<p>I had to learn SQL in order to build the databases. In the course of doing this
project I worked through the <a href="https://lagunita.stanford.edu/courses/DB/2014/SelfPaced/about">Stanford Databases MOOC by Jennifer
Widom</a>. I
completed <code>DB1 Introduction and Relational Databases</code>, <code>DB4 Relational Algebra</code>, <code>DB5 SQL</code> and <code>DB8 Relational Design Theory</code>. DB4 and DB8 helped me
design the schema and DB5 improved my very hackish/amateur queries into much
more elegant and readable ones.</p>
<p>Lastly, I was able to stretch my mind by architecting a complex system. It's
kind of like thinking about the Lego parts you'll need to 3D-print to build the
rocket ship you have in mind. It was a good exercise to think about what parts
I needed in the system and how they would talk to each other. (I guess this is
what senior SWEs like Chris and David do in their sleep.) I've greatly
simplified the architecture in my breezy explanation---the actual architecture
I built has more moving parts, and it was quite challenging for me.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I am very glad that my knowledge of statistics and behavioural economics could
be brought to bear in this project. I have always gone through my degree
thinking that it was useless for doing anything technical.</p>
<p>This project gave me an idea about my comparative advantage in data science.
While it isn't difficult for a computer science major to learn statistics, many
of them might not have done so. If I max out my statistics and maintain my
ability to write software I could be some sort data-scientist data-engineer
hybrid; not a &quot;pure&quot; data scientist but someone who likes to get his hands
dirty wrangling the code and building the systems.</p>
