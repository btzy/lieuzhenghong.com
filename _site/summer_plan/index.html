<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This is what I plan to do this summer.</p>
<h1>Politics</h1>
<p>I aim to put up at least two working papers with a view towards publishing
them. This closely relates to my upcoming Master's in data science. The summer
grant would help defray the costs of running the many computationally-expensive
simulations I will require for my working paper.</p>
<h2>MGGG GSoC project</h2>
<ul>
<li>Call Bhushan on Monday: see what I'll be doing.
<ul>
<li>Figuring out what communities of interest are (optimal transport? arxiv link <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.09618.pdf">here</a>)</li>
<li>Building geopandas in Julia? (have to learn Julia first)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Try and get my thesis published as a working paper</h2>
<ul>
<li>Email Andy about next steps</li>
<li>Maybe get Tak Huen to co-author with me</li>
<li>Probably need to clean up the code and all the files</li>
</ul>
<h2>Try and get my work with Eubank and Rodden published as a working paper</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wait for Nick's email back on Monday, see if he's still interested.</li>
<li>Spend a few days looking through the codebase</li>
<li>Double check the code to make sure it's giving correct results (how?)
<ul>
<li>Write tests? (Is it worth it??)</li>
<li>Move to Julia??? (no---absolutely not---horrible idea)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>See if there's a better way to memoise computations rather than saving the
distance matrix as an enormous file (I already solved the &quot;huge file in
memory&quot; problem with my thesis by reading line-by-line)</li>
</ul>
<h1>Data Science and Programming</h1>
<h2>Build (parallel) path tracer (using BDRF) in Julia with Ross and Doyun</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>How do I learn about path tracers? Theory?</strong> Is there a textbook?</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask Ross about the theory of path tracing</li>
<li>Write something really really simple myself before Ross comes in</li>
<li>Scope out the project</li>
<li>Prime ray generation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn the maths for Markov Chains to actually understand the BDRF function...</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://graphics.stanford.edu/courses/cs348b-01/course29.hanrahan.pdf">Stanford handout on Monte Carlo path tracing</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/Introduction/Photorealistic_Rendering_and_the_Ray-Tracing_Algorithm.html">Physically-based rendering textbook</a></li>

</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Self-study everything on the recommended reading list</h2>
<h3>Mathematics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Matrix algebra – transpose, symmetric, rank, inverse, orthogonal, trace</li>
<li>Matrix operations – multiplication, solution of linear system of equations</li>
<li>Eigenvalues, eigenvectors</li>
<li>Eigendecomposition and singular value decomposition of a matrix</li>
<li>Differentiation – including partial differentiation, Hessian matrix</li>
<li>Integration – including multiple integrals, and Jacobians and change of
variables in multiple integrals</li>
<li>Taylor series expansion</li>
<li>Difference equations</li>
</ul>
<p>The linear algebra notes
<a href="http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-linalg.pdf">5</a> cover most of the
required linear algebra. Jordan and Smith [12] covers the material at an
appropriate level. The relevant material is commonly included in books on
engineering mathematics: good examples are Kreyszig [13] and Stroud [18].</p>
<h3>Probability notes and exercises</h3>
<ul>
<li>Probability spaces</li>
<li>Random variables – discrete and continuous</li>
<li>Distributions, expectation, variance, covariance, independence</li>
<li>Joint distributions, conditional distributions, method of change of variables
using Jacobian</li>
<li>Multivariate normal distribution – basic properties</li>
<li>Moment generating functions</li>
<li>Convergence of random variables, weak and strong law of large numbers,
central limit theorem</li>
<li>Basic properties of discrete-time Markov chains and Poisson processes</li>
</ul>
<p>The Probability notes <a href="https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/node/39/materials">1</a>
cover the required material at an appropriate level, as do Chapters 1–6 of
Grimmett and Stirzaker [11]. An alternative introductory probability book is
Ross [17]. An alternative source for the material on Markov chains is Chapter 1
of Norris [14]. The books by Rice [15] and DeGroot and Schervish [9] cover
most of this material.</p>
<h3>Statistics notes and exercises</h3>
<ul>
<li>Basic exploratory plots, e.g. histograms, boxplots, Q-Q plots</li>
<li>Maximum likelihood estimation</li>
<li>Properties of estimators – unbiasedness, consistency, mean squared error</li>
<li>Delta method, asymptotic normality of maximum likelihood estimator</li>
<li>Confidence intervals – exact intervals, approximate intervals using large
sample theory</li>
<li>Hypothesis testing, types of error, including t-tests (basic, paired, two
sample)</li>
<li>Likelihood ratio tests, asymptotic distribution of likelihood ratio
statistic, applications to contingency tables, $\chi^2$ goodness-of-fit tests</li>
<li>Basic single and multiple linear regression</li>
<li>Basic Bayesian statistics – conjugate prior and posterior, maximum a
posteriori and expected posterior estimates, credible/highest posterior
density intervals</li>
</ul>
<p>The Statistics notes <a href="https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/node/40/materials">2</a>
cover the required material at an appropriate level. The books by Rice [15]
and DeGroot and Schervish [9] provide good coverage of the required material.
2 Alternative references which are very suitable for MSc preparatory reading
on statistics are Casella and Berger [7], Davison [8], Faraway [10],
Wasserman [19]. The first five chapters of [19] also provide a summary of
much of the prerequisite material on probability.</p>
<h3>Simulation notes and exercises</h3>
<p>Simulation methods: inversion, transformation, rejection. Importance sampling.
Basic aspects of Markov Chain Monte Carlo. The basics of programming, in
either R or Python.</p>
<p>Note: although simulation, and statistical programming in R, is taught in the
MSc, it is covered at a fast pace and therefore some previous experience is a
distinct advantage and expected. If you have not used R before, then you should
gain some familiarity with it before the start of the MSc. If you have used
Python but not R, we are assuming you would be able to make the transition to R
quickly – you may still want to gain some experience with R before the start of
the MSc.</p>
<p>The above material is covered in the Simulation notes [3] and the introduction to R and
programming in the Statistical Programming notes [4]. Books that cover this material at an
appropriate level are Braun and Murdoch [6], and Robert and Casella [16].</p>

<h2>Self-study: Introduction to Statistical Learning</h2>
<h1>Other fun stuff</h1>
<h2>Learn Classical Chinese</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Michael Fuller’s An Introduction to Literary Chinese. It’s much newer (1999,
revised 2004), and takes into account recent scholarship into the grammar of
Classical Chinese (“Classical” in its true sense, since most of the book’s
materials come from that period). It makes frequent references to Edwin
Pulleyblank’s Outline of Classical Chinese Grammar, so you may want to pick up
a copy of that too for reference. There are other, more recent books than
Fuller’s, but from what I’ve seen none of them are of quite the same caliber.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Fuller starts out with 8 Lessons teaching the basic structure of the
language.
He also includes a little about reading classical commentary and resources to
use when you have questions, such as large scholarly dictionaries. The second
part, Intermediate Texts, consists of 16 lessons. They are all, like the
Beginning Texts, from classical sources like Confucius, Strategies of the
Warring States, Mencius, etc. The Advanced Texts section consists of longer
readings from classical and Jin dynasty authors. The fourth part is selections
of Tang and Song dynasty prose and poetry. He gradually gives you more work to
do as the book goes on, including bibliographic exercises (verify what work X
means by using dictionary Y; find country A on the map in atlas B, etc.) and
further reading. The book is excellent, and really makes you think about why
each phrase means what it does, from both grammatical and contextual points of
view.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Goal: do one chapter a week, which will give us the basic grammar and two
intermediate texts</p>
<h2>Learn German</h2>
<p><a href="https://courses.dcs.wisc.edu/wp/readinggerman/">A Foundation Course in Learning German</a></p>
<p>16 chapters. Won't finish.</p>
<p>Goal: do one chapter a week, which will give me a lot of the grammar.</p>
<h2>(If got time) build that board game framework (during Game Jam July 10--12)?</h2>
<p>N.B. Before I came to Oxford I thought I would come out after three years being
fluent in Latin. It turns out that's very far from the truth. (I have picked up
several pretentious phrases in philosophy like <em>eo ipso</em>, <em>prima facie</em>, etc.,
but not much else)</p>
<h2>Travel around</h2>
<ul>
<li>After OberRamstadt, where?</li>

<p>Zhenghong: work with JN and Nick on getting adjacency info into Districtr and
writing functions for cut edges and contiguity checks. Time: 2-4 weeks</p>
<p>Motivation: to be able to do graphical analysis on the plans drawn by Districtr
akin to that we can do with Gerrychain</p>
<p>MVP: a Python script that takes in shapefile + district assignments (in JSON)
and returns several metrics like contiguity and number of cut edges.</p>
<p>Rough approach:</p>
<p>For each state:</p>
<ol>
<li>Import the shapefile</li>
<li>Using the shapefile, create the dual graph of a state</li>
</ol>
<p>For each proposed districting plan:</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Import the district assignments JSON</li>
<li>Using the district assignments JSON, form the graph partition (possibly with
Gerrychain, NetworkX, something else)</li>
<li>Using the graph partition, answer queries like number of cut edges and
contiguity.</li>
</ol>
<p>Questions to ask: How large is the largest district assignment
JSON? Are metrics like number of cut edges and contiguity even well-defined for
incomplete district assignments?</p>
<p>Possible extensions: Integrate into the main Districtr app, either locally on
the client or as an AWS Lambda function. Consider and implement other
interesting metrics.</p>
<h3>Thursday 25th June</h3>
<ul>
<li>Go on a hike with Celine</li>
<li>Pack up all my suitcase and boxes</li>
<li>Start working on GSoC project (finally):
<ul>
<li>Get a Colab notebook up and running</li>
<li>Make sure that it's backed up successfully to GH</li>
<li>Import the Iowa shapefile and create the dual graph of Iowa</li>
<li>That should take up the entire work block.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Attend both network talks</li>
</ul>
<h3>Friday 26th June</h3>
<p>The task description Moon set was &quot;Zhenghong: work with JN and Nick on getting
adjacency info into Districtr and writing functions for cut edges and
contiguity checks. Time: 2-4 weeks&quot;.</p>
<h2>Update for Friday 26th June 2020</h2>
<p>OK, I think I've gotten a good sense of what I was tasked to do (successfully
calculate contiguity and cut edges given a Districtr assignment JSON). My
conclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's straightforward---once you know how to do it---to convert Districtr
assignments into a GerryChain graph partition on the server-side. This is in
large part due to the helpful functions that GerryChain already possesses.</li>
<li>The assignment files are not too large, so presumably one could send the
assignments to the server after suitably compressing them. We can also modify
Districtr to send only the assignment deltas, which shouldn't be too
difficult. We'd have to do more testing on how long the partition generation
would take on the server side. Are we thinking some sort of AWS Lambda
function?</li>
<li>Generating the dual graph from a shapefile takes a long time, and these
should be precalculated and stored on the server.</li>
</ul>
<p>What should I do next?</p>
<h2>Summer W2 : 28 Jun--4 Jul</h2>
