<p>I've built several pieces of software.</p>

<h2>Phonics Game</h2>
<p>July 2018</p>
<p>An educational game for kids aged 7-8 to learn &quot;vowel teams&quot;, made for the
Ministry of Education. I didn't know what a vowel team was
until I started this project.</p>
<p>Built with HTML Canvas and JavaScript, with art from the (extremely) talented
Shan Wei. Available to play <a href="lieuzhenghong.com/phonics-game-poc">here</a>.</p>

<h2>Dropship Chess</h2>
<p>September 2017</p>
<p>A game built for the the Jack computer, a computer we build ourselves from
scratch (NAND gates) as part of the (excellent) course <a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org/course">From NAND to
Tetris</a>.</p>
<p>It's chess played on a 6x6 board where captured enemy pieces can be
&quot;airdropped&quot; anywhere on the board in lieu of moving a piece, kind of like
Shogi/Bughouse. White starts with two knights and Black with two bishopsâ€”so you
have to capture the opponent's knights/bishops to get your own.</p>
<p>NAND To Tetris is an excellent overview of computer architecture. You start
with a NAND gate and build full adders and mutliplexers from it. You then build
basic processing and storage devices (ALU, RAM , CPU, display). Then you build an
assembler, then a VM, then an interpreter, then a full-fledged parser/lexer and
compiler for a high level language called Jack, and finally you write the OS
for the computer in Jack! At the end of the course you've built a computer
which supports a high-level language and can run a highly nontrivial
program (Tetris) starting only from NAND gates. Awesome!</p>
