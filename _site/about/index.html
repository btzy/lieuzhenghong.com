<h2> About me </h2>

<p>I read Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) at Merton College, Oxford.
In my degree I most enjoyed learning about
game theory, computational political science, and causal inference.</p>
<p>I also like computer science and data science.
My favourite MOOCs are
Noam Nisan and Simon Shocken's NAND 2 Tetris,
Tim Roughgarden's Algorithms, and
Martin Odersky's Functional Programming Specialisation.
You can read my reviews of them and several other courses <a href="..">here</a>.</p>
<p>I like building things: some useful, others useless, but always fun.
You can read about some of them <a href="/projects">on my projects page</a>.</p>

I wrote daily reports about my life.
I quickly dropped this habit as it took way too much time
and I was lazy,
but it was nonetheless primarily used to review my life
every so often. In an earlier iteration of my homepage I wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I use this page as a personal diary. In it I record my thoughts and feelings, my views and goals, my struggles and triumphs. I like looking at my old posts and see how I have changed. I particularly enjoy reading the problems that faced me in the past and seeing how they were overcome (or not).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over time, the audience of this website grew from 1 to several,</p>
<p>But I didn't want to lose the authenticity/frankness of my website.</p>
<p>I am now enforcing a division between</p>
