Dear Bassel,

Have been putting this email off for so long---
not because I didn't want to send you an email, but simply because
whenever I got down to writing it, there was always a new and exciting thing
happening over the horizon,
and I would decide to delay the email to incorporate that new thing.
Now that things have settled down somewhat, here is the email that
I should have sent a month ago!

1. On exam results
2. What we've been up to:
   - Game theory post is up
   - Vacation at Celine's and in the Schwartzwald
   - Rejected Harvard offer
3. On the calligraphy I wrote

## On exam results

## What we've been up to

### Game theory post is up

### Vacation at Celine's and in the Schwartzwald

### Rejected Harvard offer

## On the calligraphy I wrote for you

This Tang Dynasty poem tells the story of the poet and his close friend,
two scholar-officials posted far from their homes.
His close friend has received a new, prestigious official posting
hundreds of miles away: they may never see each other again.
Despite being written almost fourteen hundred years ago,
the poem reflects aptly my feelings.

I have translated it as best I can, but I am of course no poet:

《送杜少府之任蜀洲》

城闕輔三秦，風煙望五津。
與君離別意，同是宦游人。
海內存知己，天涯若比鄰。
無為在歧路，兒女共沾巾。

Sending Off Vice Prefect Du on His Way to His Post in Suzhou

O'er the spires and walls of the Three Qins, our land,
There in wind and white mist, the Five Rivers descend.
We must say our farewells, leave each other behind
For the faraway posts that our liege lord's assigned.

While the vast seas bind us, we remain bosom friends;
We are neighbours in heart, though apart at sky's ends.
Though our paths must now part, and I hold you most dear,
Lest like children we weep, let us hold back our tears!

I must also bid farewell to a beloved teacher and mentor.
Thank you once again for everything that you've done for me.
It was truly my good fortune, and an absolute honour, to have been your student
these past two years.
